<h2>About me</h2>

I will join Wuhan University, School of Artificial Intelligence as a Full Professor in May, 2025. Before joining Wuhan University, I was an associate research scientist and postdoc Researcher at Yale University hosted by Professor <a href='https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/'>Hua Xu</a>, Cornell University hosted by Professor <a href='https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/index.html'>Fei Wang</a>, and research associate at the University of Manchester hosted by Professor <a href='https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou'>Sophia Ananiadou</a> and Professor <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h3aNnAIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Junichi Tsujii</a>, from 2021 to 2025. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Wuhan University in December, 2020, under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2893.htm'>Min Peng</a>. I have visited University of Montreal for one year under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W7uYg0UAAAAJ&hl=en'>Jian-Yun Nie</a> (2019-2020).

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its application in medicine and finance. My work spans across:

- **Reasoning and Explainability**: Enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities for structured decision-making and interpretability.

- **Medical and Financial NLP**: Investigating how domain-specific knowledge improves robustness, factual accuracy, and explainability of generative AI in high-stakes applications.
  
- **Text Understanding and Generation**: Learning text representation with probabilistic explainability and improving factuality and hallucination of generative AI models on text generation.
  
**Looking for highly self-motivated Postdoc, Ph.D. student, master student, research assistant and research intern.** If you are interested in join my research group, please feel free to reach out.
