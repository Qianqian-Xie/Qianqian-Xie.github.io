I will join Wuhan University, School of Artificial Intelligence as a Full Professor in May, 2025. Before joining Wuhan University, I was an associate research scientist and postdoc Researcher at Yale University hosted by Professor [Hua Xu] (https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/), Cornell University hosted by Professor [Fei Wang] (https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/index.html), and research associate at the University of Manchester hosted by Professor [Sophia Ananiadou] (https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou) and Professor [Junichi Tsujii] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h3aNnAIAAAAJ&hl=en), from 2021 to 2025. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Wuhan University in December, 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Min Peng] (https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2893.htm). I have visited University of Montreal for one year under the supervision of Professor [Jian-Yun Nie] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=W7uYg0UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) (2019-2020).

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with an emphasis on **Large Language Models (LLMs), intelligent healthcare, and intelligent finance**. I am interested in efficient training, domain adaptation, explainability, and the robustness of LLMs in specialized applications. Specifically, my work spans across:

- **Efficient Pre-training and Model Compression**: Exploring methods such as pruning, quantization, and conditional computation to build smaller yet highly competitive models. My work on structured pruning and knowledge distillation has advanced resource-efficient LLM training, as demonstrated in **NeurIPS, ACL, and KDD** publications.

- **Biomedical and Financial NLP**: Investigating how domain-specific knowledge improves model robustness, factual accuracy, and explainability in high-stakes applications. My research has contributed to clinical decision support systems, medical summarization, and financial information extraction.

- **Hallucination and Misinformation Detection**: Evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLM-generated content, particularly in healthcare and finance. I have developed benchmarks and algorithms to improve model trustworthiness, as highlighted in **NPJ Digital Medicine, TOIS, and IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering**.

- **Reasoning and Explainability**: Enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities for structured decision-making and interpretability. My work includes developing **graph-based reasoning models and topic-driven transformers**, pushing the boundaries of explainable AI.

My recent projects include **Me-LLaMA: Medical Foundation Large Language Models for Comprehensive Text Analysis** (NPJ Digital Medicine, 2025) and **FinBen: A Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models** (NeurIPS 2024). Additionally, I have contributed to **MetaAligner**, an alignment framework for multi-objective model tuning, and **FinCon**, a financial multi-agent system for decision-making.

My research previous was supported by the **NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)** and the **National High-Level Young Talent Program (Overseas, NSFC)**. I have received multiple awards, including the **CCL Best English Paper Award** and recognition for my contributions to AI-driven financial misinformation detection.

I actively contribute to the AI research community as **Program Chair for COLING 2025 FinNLP Workshop**, **Area Chair for ACL 2025, ACL 2023, and EMNLP 2023**, and a reviewer for **ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, AAAI, KDD, Nature Medicine, and TOIS**. I also mentor students and lead research projects in clinical and financial NLP applications.

Beyond academia, I have collaborated with industry, interning at **Alibaba DAMO Academy**, where I worked on improving multi-turn dialogue systems using graph neural networks. My work has led to practical advancements in AI-driven conversational systems and domain-specific LLM applications.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. If you are interested in my work or potential partnerships, feel free to reach out!
