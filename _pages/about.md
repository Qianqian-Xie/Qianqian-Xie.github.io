I will join Wuhan University, School of Artificial Intelligence as a full professor in May, 2025. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Software and Theory at Wuhan University and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Jiangxi Normal University. Before joining Wuhan University as a faculty member, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Yale University School of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College, and an Assistant Researcher at the University of Manchester.

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with an emphasis on **Large Language Models (LLMs), intelligent healthcare, and intelligent finance**. I am interested in efficient training, domain adaptation, explainability, and the robustness of LLMs in specialized applications. Specifically, my work spans across:

- **Efficient Pre-training and Model Compression**: Exploring methods such as pruning, quantization, and conditional computation to build smaller yet highly competitive models. My work on structured pruning and knowledge distillation has advanced resource-efficient LLM training, as demonstrated in **NeurIPS, ACL, and KDD** publications.

- **Biomedical and Financial NLP**: Investigating how domain-specific knowledge improves model robustness, factual accuracy, and explainability in high-stakes applications. My research has contributed to clinical decision support systems, medical summarization, and financial information extraction.

- **Hallucination and Misinformation Detection**: Evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLM-generated content, particularly in healthcare and finance. I have developed benchmarks and algorithms to improve model trustworthiness, as highlighted in **NPJ Digital Medicine, TOIS, and IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering**.

- **Reasoning and Explainability**: Enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities for structured decision-making and interpretability. My work includes developing **graph-based reasoning models and topic-driven transformers**, pushing the boundaries of explainable AI.

My recent projects include **Me-LLaMA: Medical Foundation Large Language Models for Comprehensive Text Analysis** (NPJ Digital Medicine, 2025) and **FinBen: A Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models** (NeurIPS 2024). Additionally, I have contributed to **MetaAligner**, an alignment framework for multi-objective model tuning, and **FinCon**, a financial multi-agent system for decision-making.

My research previous was supported by the **NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)** and the **National High-Level Young Talent Program (Overseas, NSFC)**. I have received multiple awards, including the **CCL Best English Paper Award** and recognition for my contributions to AI-driven financial misinformation detection.

I actively contribute to the AI research community as **Program Chair for COLING 2025 FinNLP Workshop**, **Area Chair for ACL 2025, ACL 2023, and EMNLP 2023**, and a reviewer for **ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, AAAI, KDD, Nature Medicine, and TOIS**. I also mentor students and lead research projects in clinical and financial NLP applications.

Beyond academia, I have collaborated with industry, interning at **Alibaba DAMO Academy**, where I worked on improving multi-turn dialogue systems using graph neural networks. My work has led to practical advancements in AI-driven conversational systems and domain-specific LLM applications.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. If you are interested in my work or potential partnerships, feel free to reach out!
